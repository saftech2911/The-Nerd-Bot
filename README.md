## **The Nerd Bot**

 **Introduction**

This Discord Chatbot, developed in Python, was created during COVID-19 to fetch resources directly from my study resources website (the website is currently shut down). Students had the opportunity to type in commands in any text channel of the Discord Server in which the bot was added, and necessary resources would be delivered to them on demand. Originally, this Bot used to run in Repl.it, triggered by periodic pings from Uptime Robot so that the botâ€™s source code ran continuously. This GitHub repository was created to facilitate reviewing the project by Caltech admissions.
